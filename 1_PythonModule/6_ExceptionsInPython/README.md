# 6_ExceptionsInPython

...

This folder includes the material in the "Exceptions in Python" module with assignments and a project focused on handling errors and exceptions in Python through practical exercises and interactive programs.

    Assignment: Practice exercises using Python's try/except structure to handle common errors like division 
                by zero, invalid input, and working with lists and dictionaries.
    Project: This project is about making a calculator that catches errors, checks user input, saves error 
            logs, and is easy to use.
