# 5_FunctionsInPython

This folder includes the material in the "Functions in Python" module with assignments and a project focused on applying Python functions, default and variable parameters, and recursion through hands-on coding exercises.

    Assignment: Practice exercises using Pythonâ€™s function parameters, default values, variable arguments, 
                and recursion to solve real-world problems and reinforce understanding of reusable code.
    Project: This project applies knowledge of functions and recursion through building an interactive 
                menu-driven program that calculates factorials, finds Fibonacci numbers, and draws recursive fractal patterns using turtle graphics.
